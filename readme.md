This project includes a class for representing big integers in c++. 

The class supports the following operations: 
* addition(+) 
* subtraction(-) 
* multiplication(*)
* division(/)
* increment(++)
* decrement(--)
* addition assignment(+=)
* subtraction assignment(-=) 
* equality comparison(==)
* inequality(!=)
* greater than(>)
* less than(<)
* greater than or equal to(>=)
* less than or equal to(<=)

These operations work exactly like the default int in C++.
To use the class, simply include the header file "bigint.h" in your project.
